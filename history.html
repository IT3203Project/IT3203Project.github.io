                <h3>The History of DNS</h3>
                <p>
                  In the early days of the Internet, the process of assigning addresses was manual. 
                  “Computers and their associated hostnames and addresses were added to the HOSTS.TXT file by contacting the SRI Network Information Center”(Petrova, 2025). 
                  HOSTS.TXT was a single file managed by Stanford Research Institute’s (SRI) Network Information Center (NIC). 
                  It contained a name to address mapping for every host connected to the ARPAnet (a precursor to the Internet). 
                  HOSTS.TXT was distributed from a single host (SRI-NIC), and ARPAnet administrators could email their changes to the NIC and periodically grab a current version of HOSTS.TXT, which was typically updated once or twice a week, via ftp (O'Reilly, n.d.). 
                  As the network grew, this method of managing hostnames became untenable. 
                  Not only did the host file continue to grow, but so did the amount of traffic accessing it.   
                </p>

                <p>
                   In 1983, Paul Mockapetris began the process of creating a decentralized model that would still let people use names for network resources, 
                   but would be organized in such a way that would “ensure the system could accommodate diversity without unnecessary restriction” (Petrova, 2025). 
                   He published his findings in RFC 882, which “introduces domain style names, their use for ARPA Internet mail and host address support, 
                   and the protocols and servers used to implement domain name facilities” (Mockapetris, 1983).
                   These concepts were expanded upon in RFC 1034 and RFC 1035, which were published in 1987 and are widely considered the foundational documents of the Domain Name System (Petrova, 2025). 
                </p>

                <p>
                  In RFC 1034, Mockapetris describes how the Internet’s rapid growth created the need for the DNS protocol. 
                  “The sheer size of the database and frequency of updates,” he writes in reference to the aforementioned HOSTS.TXT file, 
                  “suggest that it must be maintained in a distributed manner, with local caching to improve performance (Mockapetris, 1987). 
                  “Approaches that attempt to collect a consistent copy of the entire database,” he goes on to say, 
                  “will become more and more expensive and difficult, and hence should be avoided (Mockapetris, 1987).
