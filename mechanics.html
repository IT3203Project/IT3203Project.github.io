                <h3>How DNS Works</h3>
                <p>
                   Having clearly established the need for the Domain Name System, it now becomes necessary to understand how DNS works. 
                   To understand this process, it is important to understand the four different servers involved in loading a webpage. 
                   These include the DNS recursor, the root nameserver, the top-level domain (TLD) nameserver, and the authoritative nameserver (Cloudflare, a, n.d.). 
                   A DNS query is usually initiated by a user’s web browser. To resolve a domain name to an IP address, the browser first checks its cache to see if it already knows the IP address for the desired destination. 
                   If the IP address is not stored in cache memory, the browser reaches out to the resolver. The resolver then reaches out to the root server, the TLD server, 
                   and the authoritative nameserver in succession. After obtaining the IP address from the authoritative nameserver, it passes the IP address back to the browser, 
                   which can then initiate the connection with the web server. 
                </p>

                <p>
                   The resolver, also known as the recursive resolver, is the first stop in a DNS query and acts as a middleman between a client and a DNS nameserver (Cloudflare, b, n.d.). 
                   The resolver receives the DNS query from the web client and either responds with cached data or sends a request to the root nameserver (Cloudflare, b, n.d.). 
                   Most Internet users use a recursive resolver provided by their ISP.  
                </p>

                <p>
                   The root nameserver is one of 13 servers known to every recursive resolver. This nameserver receives the DNS query from the recursive resolver, examines the domain name, 
                   and directs the resolver to the appropriate TLD nameserver based on the domain’s extension (Cloudflare, b, n.d.). 
                   The root nameservers are overseen by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). 
                </p>

                <p>
                   After getting a response from the root nameserver, the recursor reaches out to the appropriate TLD nameserver. 
                   A TLD nameserver “maintains information for all the domain names that share a common domain extension, such as .com, or .net” (Cloudflare, b, n.d.). 
                   These servers are managed by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), which breaks the server into two main groups including generic top-level domains and country code top-level domains (Cloudflare, b, n.d.). 
                   It is the TLD nameserver’s job to direct the resolver to the appropriate authoritative nameserver for the desired domain.
                </p>

                <p>
                   Authoritative nameservers represent the last stop on the resolver’s quest to locate an IP address. 
                   These servers contain “information specific to the domain name it serves and can provide a recursive resolver with the IP address of that server found in the DNS A record” (Cloudflare, b, n.d.). 
                   The resolver can now pass the IP address along to the web client, which can initiate the connection with the web server.
